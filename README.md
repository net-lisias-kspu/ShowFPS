## Description

### Features

Simple framerate counter in the top right corner of the screen. For those that don't have access to the usual Windows utilities for display it, like Linux users.

Graph window to show FPS over time.  Graph shows current FPS, a moving average of the FPS, and the Simulation rate (ie:  how much is it lagging, related to yellow/red clocking).  It can also show a line of a normal sim rate (no lagging).

Along the left of the graph will be a scale for the FPS.  Along the right will be a scale for the symrate.

### Usage

Just press `F8` for toggle the FPS counter on and off. Pressing `Ctrl+F8`
while is enabled will also do a very minimalist benchmark, calculating the 
average FPS and the lowest count.

You can click and drag the counter anywhere you like. You might also change
the default key `F8` to anything you like in the `settings.cfg` file.


#### Graph Window Controls

	Buttons
		Refresh					Redraw the graph
		Clear					Clear all data form graph 
		Rescale					Rescale the graph to fix all the data.

	Toggles
		Show Max Symrate		Show a grey line of what the normal (no losses) symrate should be
		Periodic auto-rescale	Will automatically rescale the graph once a minute, if necessary

	Sliders
		Transparency			Lets the background of the graph be transparent.  Only takes effect on newly drawn lines or by resizing the graph
		Frequency				How often to plot a datapoint

	Resizer
		A resizer control is at the lower right of the screen.  Click and drag it to resize the window

The toggle and slider settings are saved between game sessions
